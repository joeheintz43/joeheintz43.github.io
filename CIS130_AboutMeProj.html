					I am Joe and I am 20 years old.  I am a CIS major who loves computers and everything tech. I hope to one day be able to make a living off of programming and software development.

				I have been coding for nearly 3 years now, and I started with HTML and JavaScript. So, I have a good grasp on HTML and JS, but I excited to be working with CSS because it is new for me. I enjoy working with computers, and have built a handful of computers for myself, friends, and family.  
				I hope to become a software developer once I graduate from here and eventually MSU. I also play guitar in my spare time.  I hope this class can accelerate my knowledge to prep me for my dream career.

			I also am taking networking classes and a Linux class for my electives to learn as much about computers as possible during my tenure with OTC.
